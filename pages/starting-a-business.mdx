# Starting a Business

Are you ready to turn your passion into a thriving business? In this section, we'll explore the key steps to **starting a business with no money** and finding your true calling. 

Many people believe that you need a groundbreaking idea or significant capital to start a business, but that's not always the case. The most successful businesses often begin with a simple concept: **doing what you love**.

<Steps>

### Step 1: Identify your passions

Start by making a list of the things you enjoy doing. What activities make you lose track of time? What topics do you find yourself constantly researching? These passions can be anything from a hobby to a skill you've developed over the years.

### Step 2: Brainstorm business ideas

Once you've identified your passions, think about how you can turn them into a viable business. Consider the following questions:

- What problems can you solve with your skills or knowledge?
- Is there a gap in the market that your passion could fill?
- Can you offer a unique perspective or approach to an existing industry?

</Steps>

Remember, your business idea doesn't need to be completely original. In fact, many successful businesses have thrived in crowded markets by offering a better customer experience or a fresh perspective.

When starting fluid, one of Asia's biggest creative agencies, I didn't have a groundbreaking idea. I simply combined my love for marketing with my partner's talent for turning ideas into stunning visuals. Despite facing 500 competitors, we succeeded by focusing on what we loved and constantly pushing the boundaries of what was possible.
