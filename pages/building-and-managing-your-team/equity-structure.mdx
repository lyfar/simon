# Equity Structure

Understanding how equity works and structuring it correctly is crucial for the success of your business. Getting the equity structure wrong can lead to conflicts, loss of control, and even the failure of your company. In this section, we'll dive into the intricacies of equity and share ownership, and provide you with the knowledge you need to make informed decisions.

## Equity Ownership â‰  Control

One of the most common misconceptions about equity is that owning more than 50% of the shares equals control. This is not true. Control is determined by the **shareholder agreement**, not the percentage of equity owned. You can have a 50/50 split with a partner and still allocate decision-making power to one person.

## Understand Your Endgame

Before deciding on your equity structure, you need to have a clear understanding of where you want to take your business. Are you planning to raise multiple rounds of funding? Do you intend to go public? Different goals require different equity strategies.

## 50/50 Partnerships

In the case of co-founders, a 50/50 equity split is often the fairest and most straightforward approach. Avoid the temptation to give one founder a slight majority (e.g., 52/48) based on the idea origin. This can lead to resentment and imbalance in the long run.

However, with a 50/50 split, you need to have a plan for resolving deadlocks. Consider having a trusted third party, such as an advisor or board member, to help make decisions in case of disagreements.

## Equity for Employees

Giving equity to your employees can be a powerful way to incentivize and retain top talent. There are two main approaches:

1. **Share Options**: Employees are granted the right to purchase shares at a predetermined price in the future. This is often tied to a vesting schedule and can be a good way to align employee interests with the company's success.

2. **Direct Equity**: Employees are given actual ownership in the company. This approach provides a stronger sense of ownership but can be more complex to manage.

## Know Your Share Classes

Not all shares are created equal. Different classes of shares come with different rights and privileges. Common share classes include:

- **Class A**: Usually reserved for founders and early investors, with the most voting rights.
- **Class B**: Often issued to employees and later-stage investors, with fewer voting rights.
- **Preferred Shares**: Typically held by investors, with special rights such as liquidation preferences.

Understanding the differences between share classes is essential when structuring your equity and negotiating with investors.

## The Importance of Vesting

Vesting is a mechanism that ensures equity is earned over time, rather than being fully owned upfront. A typical vesting schedule is four years, with a one-year cliff. This means that if an employee leaves before the first year, they don't get any equity, and after that, they earn their equity gradually over the remaining three years.

Vesting protects the company from giving away too much equity too soon and helps ensure that employees are committed for the long haul.

## Seek Professional Advice

Equity structure is a complex topic with legal and tax implications. It's essential to seek the advice of experienced professionals, such as lawyers and accountants, to ensure that your equity structure is set up correctly and in compliance with all relevant regulations.
