# Preparing to Sell

Selling your business can be a daunting task, but with the right strategies and mindset, you can ensure a successful exit. In this section, we'll cover the key considerations and steps you need to take when preparing to sell your company.

## The Power of Not Wanting to Sell

One of the most powerful positions you can be in when selling your business is *not actually wanting to sell it*. This may seem counterintuitive, but when you're not desperate to sell, you have the upper hand in negotiations.

The most amount of money I ever got for a company was because I didn't want to sell it. That's the strongest place to negotiate from.

Focus on building a business you love, and selling it will happen accidentally. This has been proven time and time again throughout history. Take Mark Zuckerberg, for example. He turned down a billion-dollar offer from Yahoo to buy Facebook because he believed in his vision. Now, Facebook is worth over a trillion dollars.

## Partnering with Potential Buyers

Another effective strategy for selling your business is to partner with a company that could potentially buy it. Work on projects together and build a strong relationship. This can lead to an organic acquisition opportunity.

### Step 1
Identify companies that could benefit from acquiring your business. Look for strategic partnerships or complementary services.

### Step 2
Reach out to these companies and propose working together on a project or initiative. Focus on building a mutually beneficial relationship, not on selling your business.

### Step 3 
As you work together, demonstrate the value your company brings to the table. If the partnership is successful, the other company may naturally express interest in acquiring your business.

## Working with Business Brokers

If you don't have the time or resources to actively seek out buyers, you can work with business brokers or agents who specialize in selling companies. However, be cautious when choosing a broker and make sure to:

- Do your due diligence and ask for references from previous clients
- Ensure the legal structure and fees are clearly outlined
- Remember that brokers may have their own agendas, so always prioritize your own interests

## Considering a Merger

Merging with a competitor can be an easy way to sell your business, but it may not always yield the highest value. In my experience, selling to a company outside your industry can sometimes lead to a higher valuation.

D --> F(Requires More Effort)
```

## Offering a Management Buyout

Finally, consider allowing your management team to buy the business. This can be a win-win situation, as it allows you to exit the company while ensuring its continued success under the leadership of people who are already invested in its growth.

There are various ways to structure a management buyout, such as:

- Gradual buyout over time
- Percentage of profit
- Seller financing

I personally was really happy to sell my company, Nest, to my team. It's a powerful way of building an exit strategy for yourself while also giving the people who run it the love and success they deserve.

Remember, the key to a successful exit is to [build a business you love](/introduction) and never pitch to investors that you're building a company to sell. Focus on creating value, and the opportunities will come.
