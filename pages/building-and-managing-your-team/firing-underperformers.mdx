# Firing Underperformers

Letting go of employees who aren't meeting expectations is a necessary but challenging part of running a business. It's important to approach this process with care and professionalism to minimize the impact on your team and your company's reputation.

## The Seven and Eight Rule

I've developed a system called the "seven and eight rule" to help identify when an employee needs to be let go:

- **Nines and tens:** These are your top performers who love their work and consistently exceed expectations. Keep them engaged and rewarded.
- **Ones and twos:** These employees are clearly not a good fit and typically leave or are fired quickly.
- **Sevens and eights:** These employees are the trickiest to manage. They're almost good enough but never quite meet expectations. They take up a disproportionate amount of your time and energy.

If you find yourself constantly discussing an employee's performance, they're likely a seven or eight. It's crucial to address this issue head-on.

Keeping seven and eights around can demotivate your top performers, who may leave if they see mediocre work being tolerated.

## How to Fire Someone

<Steps>

### Step 1: Set clear expectations and provide support

Before considering termination, ensure you've clearly communicated your expectations and provided the necessary resources and support for the employee to succeed. Document these efforts.

### Step 2: Have an honest conversation

Schedule a meeting with the employee to discuss their performance. Be direct but compassionate. Explain why their work isn't meeting expectations and listen to their perspective.

### Step 3: Develop an improvement plan

If you believe the employee has the potential to improve, work with them to create a specific, measurable plan with a timeline for improvement. Make sure they understand the consequences of not meeting these goals.

### Step 4: Follow through

If the employee fails to improve despite your support, it's time to let them go. Consult with HR or legal counsel to ensure you follow proper procedures.

## The Upside of Firing

While it's never easy, firing an underperforming employee can have positive effects:

- It sends a message that mediocrity won't be tolerated, boosting morale and productivity.
- It frees up resources to hire someone who's a better fit for the role and your company culture.
- It allows the fired employee to find a job that better suits their skills and interests.

Remember, as a leader, your primary responsibility is to the health and success of your business. By addressing performance issues directly and humanely, you'll build a stronger, more resilient team.
